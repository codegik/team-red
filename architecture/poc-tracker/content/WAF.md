* 🤖 **Bot Control**: Detect and mitigate **malicious bots**, while allowing good bots (like search engines).
* 📊 **Rate-based Rules**: Automatically **throttle or block** IPs that exceed defined request limits.
* 🌐 **Geo Blocking**: Control access based on the **geographic origin** of requests.
* 🔍 **Real-time Monitoring**: Integrated with **CloudWatch** for metrics and **S3/Kinesis** for detailed logging.
* 🔁 **Flexible Rule Engine**: Create **custom rules** with logical conditions using **Web ACLs**.
* 🔒 **Security Integration**: Works with **CloudFront**, **ALB**, **API Gateway**, and **App Runner**.

### Common Use Cases

* 🛡️ **Protect web apps** from common exploits like SQL injection or XSS.
