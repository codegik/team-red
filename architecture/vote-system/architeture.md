# 🧬 Realtime Voting System -- Architecture Overview

# 1. 🏛️ Structure

## 1.1 🎯 Problem Statement and Context

This document describes the high-level architecture and security
strategy for a global, real-time voting system designed to support:

- Up to 300 million registered users
- Traffic peaks of 240,000 requests per second (RPS)
- Strict consistency and reliability guarantees
- Strong protection against bots, fraud, and abuse
- One-person-one-vote enforcement
- Near real-time result visibility

The system must be fully cloud-native, highly scalable, fault tolerant,
and secure by design, while explicitly avoiding:

## 1.2 Restrictions

- Serverless platforms outside AWS
- MongoDB
- On-premise infrastructure
- Google Cloud & Microsoft Azure
- OpenShift
- Mainframes
- Monolithic architectures

AWS-based, fully distributed, microservices-first architecture is
assumed.

## 1.3 Problem Space

**What is the problem?**

We need to design and build a globally distributed, mission-critical real-time voting system capable of handling 300 million registered users with peak traffic of 240,000 requests per second. The system must guarantee absolute data integrity, enforce strict one-person-one-vote constraints, provide real-time result visibility, and defend against sophisticated fraud, bot attacks, and abuse at scale—all while maintaining near-zero data loss and high availability across multiple geographic regions.

**What is the context of the problem?**

- **Market Context**:
  - Democratic elections and large-scale voting events demand unprecedented levels of trust, transparency, and reliability
  - Growing threat landscape from automated bots, state-sponsored actors, and coordinated fraud campaigns
  - Increasing expectations for instant feedback and real-time results from 300M+ global participants
  - Zero tolerance for data loss, system failures, or security breaches that could undermine election integrity
  - Need for systems that can scale elastically during unpredictable traffic spikes (campaigns, debates, breaking news)

- **Business Context**:
  - Any data loss or security breach creates legal liability, regulatory penalties, and irreparable reputational damage
  - System must support mission-critical operations with financial and legal consequences
  - One-time deployment windows with no room for failure during live voting periods
  - Requirement for complete auditability and tamper-proof logging for legal compliance
  - Cost optimization critical—infrastructure must scale down after peak periods
  - Must support strict SLAs with penalties for downtime or data inconsistency

- **Technical Context**:
  - Peak traffic of 240K RPS eliminates traditional vertical scaling and monolithic architectures
  - 300M users require geo-distributed sharding, multi-region replication, and CDN distribution
  - ACID guarantees required for vote integrity—NoSQL eventually consistent models insufficient for vote records
  - Real-time requirements demand event-driven architecture (Kafka, SSE) with <2 second latency
  - Cloud-native AWS-only restriction eliminates multi-cloud and serverless options
  - Must handle database bottlenecks through strategic sharding (geo-based), read replicas, and caching
  - Defense-in-depth security model required across network, identity, device, behavior, application, and data layers
  - Need for immutable audit logs and write-once-read-many (WORM) compliance

- **User Context**:
  - 300M users spread across multiple geographic regions with varying network conditions
  - Users expect instant confirmation of vote submission and real-time result updates
  - Users must be authenticated securely without friction (prevent credential stuffing, session hijacking)
  - Mobile and web clients require Server-Sent Events (SSE) for efficient real-time updates
  - Users in different time zones create distributed load patterns with unpredictable spikes
  - Accessibility requirements for diverse user populations (language, disability, device types)
  - Users must vote exactly once—any duplicate vote undermines system integrity

**Core Challenges:**

1. **Data Integrity at Scale**
   - Guarantee zero data loss across 240K RPS with multi-region active-active replication
   - Implement synchronous writes with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) and fsync guarantees
   - Build tamper-proof immutable audit trails using OpenSearch WORM indices
   - Handle database sharding across 300M users without creating consistency gaps
   - Design automatic failover with RPO=0 (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO<60s (Recovery Time Objective)

2. **Security & Fraud Prevention**
   - Detect and block automated bots at 240K RPS without impacting legitimate users
   - Prevent credential stuffing, session hijacking, replay attacks, and DDoS
   - Implement defense-in-depth: WAF, device fingerprinting, behavioral analysis, rate limiting
   - Validate identity uniqueness across 300M users without centralized bottlenecks
   - Build real-time fraud detection with ML models analyzing voting patterns

3. **Horizontal Scalability**
   - Scale API layer from baseline to 240K RPS using Kubernetes HPA and KEDA
   - Implement geo-based database sharding to distribute 300M user records
   - Design stateless microservices that auto-scale without session affinity issues
   - Optimize cache layers (Redis) to absorb read-heavy traffic and reduce DB load
   - Handle cold-start delays during sudden traffic spikes with pre-warming strategies

4. **Strict Idempotency & One-Vote Enforcement**
   - Guarantee exactly-once vote processing despite retries, network failures, and race conditions
   - Implement distributed locks or optimistic concurrency control at database level
   - Design idempotency keys with conflict resolution for duplicate submissions
   - Prevent race conditions when multiple requests arrive simultaneously for same user
   - Build reconciliation mechanisms to detect and resolve any duplicate votes in audit logs

5. **Real-Time Result Distribution**
   - Stream aggregated results to 300M users with <2 second latency using SSE
   - Design event-driven architecture (Kafka) for vote ingestion and aggregation
   - Handle 250K concurrent SSE connections with minimal server resource overhead
   - Implement efficient broadcast patterns using EventEmitter for SSE clients
   - Balance real-time updates with system load—aggregate summaries vs. individual events

6. **Multi-Region Complexity**
   - Synchronize vote data across geographic regions with strong consistency
   - Handle network partitions (split-brain scenarios) without duplicate votes
   - Route users to nearest region while maintaining global vote count accuracy
   - Implement cross-region disaster recovery with automated failover
   - Manage clock skew and distributed transaction coordination across regions

7. **Performance Under Load**
   - Maintain <100ms p99 latency during 240K RPS peak traffic
   - Prevent database saturation through write buffering, connection pooling, and read replicas
   - Optimize Kafka throughput for event streaming without lag buildup
   - Implement backpressure mechanisms to gracefully degrade under extreme load
   - Cache authentication tokens and session data to reduce repeated DB lookups

# 2. 🎯 Goals

## 2.1 Never Lose Data

Voting systems are mission-critical. Any data loss leads to: - Legal
risks - Loss of public trust - Invalid election outcomes

This requires: - Multi-region replication - Strong durability
guarantees - Strict write acknowledgements - Immutable audit logs

---

## 2.2 Be Secure and Prevent Bots & Bad Actors (Primary Ownership Area)

This is one of the hardest challenges at global scale. The system must
prevent:

- Automated voting (bots)
- Credential stuffing
- Distributed fraud attacks
- Replay attacks
- Session hijacking
- API scraping
- DDoS attacks

Security must be implemented in multiple layers (defense in depth): -
Network - Identity - Device - Behavior - Application - Data

---

## 2.3 Handle 300M Users

This implies: - Massive horizontal scalability - Stateless
architectures - Global CDNs - Partitioned databases - Multi-region
deployment

---

## 2.4 Handle 240K RPS Peak Traffic

This eliminates: - Vertical scaling - Centralized bottlenecks - Stateful
monoliths

It requires: - Load-based autoscaling - Event-driven processing -
Front-door traffic absorption - Backpressure handling

---

## 2.5 One Vote per User (Strict Idempotency)

This is a data + security + consistency problem: - Each identity must
be: - Verified - Unique - Non-replayable - Vote submissions must be: -
Idempotent - Conflict-safe - Race-condition proof

---

## 2.6 Real-Time Results

This creates challenges in: - Data streaming - Cache invalidation -
Broadcast consistency - Fan-out architectures - WebSocket / pub-sub
scalability

---

# 3. 🎯 Non-Goals

- On-prem or hybrid operation
- Manual moderation for fraud detection
- Single-region deployment
- Strong coupling between frontend and backend

---

# 4. 📐 Design Principles

The architecture is guided by seven foundational design principles that address the unique challenges of building a mission-critical, globally distributed voting system. These principles inform every architectural decision, from technology selection to deployment strategies.

---

## 4.1 Security First (Defense in Depth)

**Principle**: Security is not a feature—it's the foundation. Every layer of the system must assume breach and implement independent security controls.

**Why This Matters**:

- Voting systems are high-value targets for nation-state actors, organized fraud, and automated bot armies
- A single security failure can compromise election integrity and destroy public trust
- Attack vectors evolve constantly—security must be layered and adaptive

**Implementation Strategy**:

### Layer 1: Network & Edge Security

- **AWS WAF**: Block common attack patterns (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- **DDoS Protection**: AWS Shield Advanced for volumetric attack mitigation
- **Geographic Filtering**: Route53 + CloudFront geo-restrictions to block suspicious regions
- **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm at edge to prevent request flooding

### Layer 2: Identity & Authentication

- **Auth0 SSO + MFA**: Multi-factor authentication (SMS, authenticator apps, push notifications)
- **Liveness Detection**: SumSub facial biometrics to prevent fake accounts and deepfakes
- **Document Verification**: Government ID validation with fraud risk scoring
- **Session Binding**: Tokens tied to device fingerprint and IP address

### Layer 3: Device Intelligence

- **FingerprintJS**: Device fingerprinting to detect emulators, VMs, and bot farms
- **Jailbreak/Root Detection**: Block compromised devices
- **Behavioral Biometrics**: Analyze touch patterns, typing speed, mouse movements
- **Challenge-Response**: Cloudflare Turnstile for invisible human verification

### Layer 4: Application Security

- **OAuth2 Bearer Tokens**: Short-lived access tokens (15 min TTL) with secure refresh flows
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway with request validation and transformation
- **Input Sanitization**: Strict schema validation on all API requests
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning on mobile clients

### Layer 5: Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for database, S3, and backups
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all service-to-service communication
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive PII encrypted at application layer
- **Key Rotation**: Automated rotation via AWS KMS with audit trails

### Layer 6: Audit & Monitoring

- **Immutable Logs**: OpenSearch with WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) indices
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning models flagging suspicious voting patterns
- **SIEM Integration**: AWS Security Hub aggregating security events
- **Forensic Readiness**: Complete audit trail for post-incident investigation

**Trade-offs**:

- Increased latency from security checks at each layer
- Higher infrastructure costs from redundant security systems
- Potential false positives requiring manual review workflows

**Success Metrics**:

- Zero successful bot votes detected in production
- <0.01% false positive rate on fraud detection
- 100% of attacks blocked at edge (no malicious traffic reaches application layer)

---

## 4.2 Scalability by Default (Horizontal, Stateless, Elastic)

**Principle**: The system must scale horizontally without architectural changes. Every component is designed for elastic scaling from day one.

**Why This Matters**:

- Peak traffic (240K RPS) is 100x baseline load—vertical scaling is impossible
- Voting events create unpredictable traffic spikes (debates, breaking news, election day)
- Cost optimization requires scaling down after peak periods

**Implementation Strategy**:

### Stateless API Layer

- **Kubernetes Deployments**: Pods are ephemeral, interchangeable, and horizontally scalable
- **No In-Memory State**: Session data stored in Redis, not application memory
- **Container Images**: Immutable Docker images with health checks for fast startup
- **Auto-Scaling Policies**:
  - **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)**: Scale based on CPU and memory
  - **KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling)**: Scale based on Kafka lag, Redis queue depth, custom Prometheus metrics

### Database Sharding Strategy

- **Geo-Based Sharding**: Users partitioned by geographic region (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific)
- **Consistent Hashing**: User ID hashed to determine shard assignment
- **Read Replicas**: 3-5 read replicas per shard to distribute query load

### Event-Driven Asynchronous Processing

- **Kafka Partitioning**: 50+ partitions per topic for parallel consumption
- **Consumer Groups**: Multiple consumer instances per group for horizontal scaling
- **Backpressure Handling**: Kafka provides natural buffering during load spikes

**Trade-offs**:

- Cold-start delays (30-60s) when scaling from zero
- Higher infrastructure complexity with sharding and caching
- Eventual consistency in cached data (2-second lag on vote counts)

**Success Metrics**:

- Scale from 1K to 240K RPS in <5 minutes
- Maintain <100ms p99 API latency during scale-up
- Auto-scale down to baseline within 10 minutes after traffic drops

---

## 4.3 Event-Driven Architecture (Asynchronous, Decoupled, Resilient)

**Principle**: Decouple producers and consumers through event streams. All critical operations are asynchronous to prevent cascading failures.

**Why This Matters**:

- Synchronous request-response patterns create tight coupling and single points of failure
- Database writes at 240K RPS would saturate any relational database
- Real-time result aggregation requires parallel event processing

**Implementation Strategy**:

### Kafka as Central Event Bus

- **Vote Submission Topic**: All votes published as events (producer: API layer)
- **Vote Aggregation Topic**: Processed vote summaries (producer: aggregation service)
- **Audit Log Topic**: Immutable event stream for compliance
- **Replication Factor**: 3 (across availability zones for durability)

**Trade-offs**:

- Eventual consistency—vote confirmation may take 500ms to 2 seconds
- Increased operational complexity (Kafka cluster management)
- Debugging asynchronous failures is harder than synchronous flows

**Success Metrics**:

- 99.99% of events processed within 2 seconds
- Zero message loss (exactly-once semantics)
- Kafka lag <1000 messages during peak load

---

## 4.4 Stateless Compute (Immutable, Ephemeral, Replaceable)

**Principle**: Application servers hold no persistent state. Every instance is interchangeable and can be destroyed/recreated without data loss.

**Why This Matters**:

- Stateful servers cannot scale horizontally (sticky sessions create hotspots)
- Server failures with in-memory state cause data loss
- Rolling updates and auto-scaling require killing instances without warning

**Implementation Strategy**:

### Session State Externalization

- **Redis for Sessions**: All session data stored in distributed Redis cluster
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication—server validates signature without DB lookup
- **Sticky Session Elimination**: Load balancer distributes requests randomly

### Immutable Infrastructure

- **No SSH Access**: Servers are never modified after deployment
- **Configuration via Environment Variables**: All config injected at container startup
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: New versions deployed alongside old, traffic switched atomically

### Health Checks & Auto-Recovery

- **Kubernetes Liveness Probes**: Kill and restart unhealthy pods
- **Readiness Probes**: Remove pods from load balancer if not ready
- **Pod Disruption Budgets**: Ensure minimum replicas during voluntary disruptions

**Trade-offs**:

- Redis becomes critical dependency (must be highly available)
- Cannot use in-memory caching—must use distributed cache
- Slightly higher latency (network hop to Redis for every request)

**Success Metrics**:

- 100% of requests succeed even when 50% of pods are terminated
- Zero data loss during rolling updates
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR) <30 seconds

---

## 4.5 Multi-Layer Anti-Abuse Protection (Adaptive, ML-Driven, Zero Trust)

**Principle**: Assume every request is malicious until proven otherwise. Defense mechanisms adapt in real-time to emerging threats.

**Why This Matters**:

- Bots evolve to bypass static rules (CAPTCHA solving, residential proxies)
- Credential stuffing attacks leverage millions of stolen username/password pairs
- Distributed attacks from 100K+ IP addresses bypass simple rate limiting

**Implementation Strategy**:

### Static Defenses (Always Active)

- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/second per IP, 1 vote/user/election
- **IP Reputation**: Block known proxy/VPN/Tor exit nodes
- **Geo-Fencing**: Restrict voting to eligible geographic regions
- **User-Agent Validation**: Block non-standard or suspicious user agents

### Dynamic Defenses (ML-Powered)

- **Behavioral Analysis**:
  - Typing speed anomalies (too fast = bot, too slow = automation)
  - Mouse movement patterns (linear paths = automation)
  - Session duration (instant submission = bot)
- **Anomaly Detection Models**:
  - Train on legitimate user baselines
  - Flag deviations >3 standard deviations
  - Real-time scoring with SageMaker inference endpoints
- **Graph Analysis**:
  - Detect coordinated voting rings (same IP block, timing patterns)
  - Identify bot clusters by behavioral similarity

### Adaptive Challenge Escalation

```
Low Risk: No challenge
Medium Risk: Cloudflare Turnstile (invisible)
High Risk: SumSub liveness re-verification
Critical Risk: Manual review queue
```

**Trade-offs**:

- False positives frustrate legitimate users
- ML model training requires large labeled datasets
- Real-time inference adds latency

**Success Metrics**:

- Block 99.9% of bot traffic without human intervention
- False positive rate <0.1% (1 in 1000 legitimate users challenged)
- Detect novel attack patterns within 5 minutes

---

## 4.6 Auditable Data (Immutable, Tamper-Proof, Forensic-Ready)

**Principle**: Every vote and system action is recorded in an append-only, cryptographically verifiable audit log.

**Why This Matters**:

- Legal requirements for election audits and recounts
- Post-incident forensics require complete event reconstruction
- Public trust depends on transparent, verifiable vote counting

---

## 4.7 Failure as a Normal Condition (Chaos Engineering, Graceful Degradation)

**Principle**: Expect failures at every level. Design systems that degrade gracefully and self-heal automatically.

**Why This Matters**:

- At 240K RPS, component failures are guaranteed (hardware, network, software bugs)
- Manual intervention is too slow—recovery must be automatic
- Partial availability is better than complete outage

**Implementation Strategy**:

### Redundancy & Failover

- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Every component runs in 3+ availability zones
- **Database Replicas**: Automatic failover to standby within 30 seconds
- **Kafka Partition Replication**: Replicas across AZs, leader election on failure
- **Load Balancer Health Checks**: Remove failed instances within 10 seconds

### Circuit Breakers & Timeouts

- **Hystrix Pattern**: Open circuit after 5 consecutive failures
- **Timeout Budgets**: Fail fast (200ms max per external call)
- **Bulkhead Isolation**: Separate thread pools for different dependencies

### Graceful Degradation Strategies

```
Level 1: All systems operational
Level 2: Real-time results delayed (cache stale data)
Level 3: Vote submission only (read-only results page)
Level 4: Queue votes offline (process when system recovers)
```

### Chaos Engineering Practice

- **Monthly Chaos Days**: Randomly terminate 20% of pods, kill database replicas
- **Failure Injection**: Simulate network latency, dropped packets, CPU saturation
- **Game Days**: Simulate election day load + simultaneous failures

**Trade-offs**:

- Over-provisioning increases costs (3x redundancy)
- Complexity in managing degraded states
- Risk of automation making wrong decisions

**Success Metrics**:

- 99.99% uptime (52 minutes downtime/year)
- Automatic recovery from 95% of failures without human intervention
- Zero complete outages (always serve degraded service)

SumSub React Native SDK integration:

Documentation: <https://docs.sumsub.com/docs/react-native-module>

### Mobile Flow with SumSub

1. User installs and opens the React Native app.
2. During first access or registration:
    - User is asked to capture:
        - A selfie video (liveness)
        - A government-issued document
3. The app sends media directly to SumSub SDK.
4. SumSub performs:
    - Face matching
    - Liveness challenge
    - Document authenticity validation
5. The backend receives:
    - Verification status
    - Risk score
    - Unique document hash
6. Only verified users are allowed to vote.

No raw biometric data is stored directly in the voting backend.

---

### 6.1.3 Secure Authentication with Auth0 (SSO + MFA)

Auth0 is used for:

- Secure login
- Social SSO
- Passwordless login
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Token lifecycle management

Documentation: <https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/react-native>

### Authentication Flow

1. User taps "Login".
2. React Native app redirects to Auth0 universal login.
3. Auth0 performs:
    - Credential validation
    - Social login (if enabled)
    - MFA (Authenticator App, SMS, Push, etc.)
4. On success, the app receives:
    - Access Token (short-lived)
    - ID Token
    - Refresh Token (secure storage only)

---

### 6.1.4 Bot Detection with Auth0 Challenge + Turnstile

To prevent credential stuffing, brute-force, and automated accounts:

- Auth0 Challenges are applied during:
  - Login
  - Registration
  - Password reset
- Cloudflare Turnstile is used as:
  - Invisible human challenge
  - CAPTCHA replacement
  - Bot traffic filter for mobile and web

The Turnstile token is attached to authentication requests and validated
by the backend before granting access.

---

### 6.1.5 Secure API Requests with Tokens

All API requests use:

- OAuth2 access tokens (Bearer)
- Short TTL (e.g., 15 minutes)
- Secure refresh flow
- Token binding to:
  - Device fingerprint
  - Session
  - Risk score

Example:

``` http
POST /vote
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

All backend services:

- Validate the token signature
- Validate expiration and issuer
- Check device consistency
- Enforce authorization scope

---

### 6.1.6 Device Fingerprinting with FingerprintJS

FingerprintJS is used to:

- Collect passive device signals:
  - OS
  - Browser/Runtime
  - Hardware entropy
  - Emulator detection
- Generate a stable device ID
- Detect:
  - Multi-account abuse
  - Bot emulators
  - Device cloning
  - Session hijacking

How it is used:

1. FingerprintJS runs in the app runtime.
2. A device ID is generated.
3. The device ID is attached to:
    - Login requests
    - Voting requests
4. The backend correlates:
    - User Account
    - Document Hash
    - Face Template
    - Device ID

This allows detection of:

- One user trying to vote from multiple devices
- One device trying to impersonate multiple users

### 9.1 Observability and Monitoring

A robust observability strategy is critical for a system of this scale and criticality. We adopt the **three pillars of observability**: Metrics, Logs, and Traces and all using Open Source tools.

#### 9.1.1 Observability Stack Overview

| Pillar | Tool | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Metrics | Prometheus | Time-series collection and alerting |
| Visualization | Grafana | Dashboards and unified observability UI |
| Tracing | Jaeger | Distributed tracing |
| Logs | Loki | Log aggregation (Prometheus-native) |
| Alerting | Alertmanager | Alert routing and notification |
| Service Mesh Observability | OpenTelemetry | Instrumentation standard |

---

### 9.1.2 Metrics - Prometheus

Prometheus is the core metrics engine, chosen for its Open Source nature and Kubernetes-native design.

**Key Features:**

- Pull-based time-series collection via exporters
- Powerful query language (PromQL)
- Built-in alerting rules
- Service discovery for dynamic environments
- Integration with AWS via CloudWatch Exporter

**Exporters to Deploy:**

- `node_exporter` - Host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- `kube-state-metrics` - Kubernetes object states
- `cloudwatch_exporter` - AWS service metrics (RDS, SQS, ElastiCache, etc.)
- `blackbox_exporter` - Endpoint probing (HTTP, TCP, DNS)
- Custom application exporters for each microservice

**Critical Metrics to Monitor:**

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| Application | Request rate, error rate, latency (p50, p95, p99) |
| Business | Votes per second, fraud detection rate, auth success rate |
| Infrastructure | CPU, memory, disk I/O, network throughput |
| Kubernetes | Pod restarts, pending pods, node availability |
| Database | Connection pool, query latency, replication lag |
| Queue | Message age, queue depth, consumer lag |

**Prometheus Architecture for Scale:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For 300M users and high cardinality, consider **Thanos** or **Cortex** for:

- Long-term metric storage (S3-backed)
- Global query view across regions
- Downsampling for historical data

### 9.1.4 Distributed Tracing - Jaeger

For a microservices architecture at this scale, distributed tracing is essential to understand request flow and identify bottlenecks.

**Why Jaeger:**

- Open Source (CNCF graduated project)
- Native OpenTelemetry support
- Scalable architecture with Kafka and Elasticsearch/Cassandra backends
- Adaptive sampling for high-volume systems

**Tracing Architecture:**

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Instrumentation Strategy:**

| Service | Instrumentation |
|---------|-----------------|
| API Gateway | Auto-instrumentation via OpenTelemetry |
| Auth Service | Manual spans for Auth0/Sumsub calls |
| Vote Service | Manual spans for eligibility check, fraud check, vote persist |
| Fraud Service | Manual spans for risk scoring pipeline |
| Database calls | Auto-instrumentation with query tagging |
| External APIs | Manual spans with timeout tracking |

**Key Spans to Capture:**

- `http.request` - Incoming HTTP requests
- `auth.validate_token` - Token validation
- `auth.check_eligibility` - Voter eligibility check
- `fraud.check_vote` - Fraud risk assessment
- `vote.persist` - Vote storage operation
- `db.query` - Database operations
- `external.auth0` - Auth0 API calls
- `external.sumsub` - Sumsub API calls

**Sampling Strategy:**

For 240K RPS, full tracing is not feasible. Use adaptive sampling:

- 100% sampling for errors and high-latency requests
- 1% sampling for successful requests
- 100% sampling for fraud-flagged requests
- Head-based sampling with tail-based upgrade for anomalies

---

### 9.1.5 Log Aggregation - Loki

Loki provides log aggregation that integrates natively with Grafana and uses the same label model as Prometheus.

**Why Loki:**

- Open Source (Grafana Labs)
- Lightweight - indexes labels only, not full text
- Cost-effective storage (S3-backed)
- Native Grafana integration
- LogQL query language (similar to PromQL)

**Log Architecture:**

```

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Structured Logging Standard:**

All services must emit structured JSON logs:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "vote-service",
  "trace_id": "abc123",
  "span_id": "def456",
  "voter_id": "vtr_789",
  "election_id": "election_2026",
  "message": "Vote recorded successfully",
  "duration_ms": 45
}
```

**Required Log Labels:**

- `service` - Service name
- `environment` - prod/staging/dev
- `region` - AWS region
- `level` - Log level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)

**Log Retention Policy:**

- ERROR logs: 90 days
- WARN logs: 30 days
- INFO logs: 14 days
- DEBUG logs: 3 days (staging only)

---

### 9.1.6 Alerting - Alertmanager

Prometheus Alertmanager handles alert routing, deduplication, and notification.

**Alert Categories:**

| Severity | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Critical (P1) | < 5 min | Service down, data loss risk, security breach |
| High (P2) | < 30 min | High error rate, degraded performance |
| Medium (P3) | < 4 hours | Elevated latency, resource warnings |
| Low (P4) | Next business day | Non-critical warnings |

**Critical Alerts for Voting System:**

```yaml
# Example alert rules
groups:
  - name: voting-critical
    rules:
      - alert: VoteServiceDown
        expr: up{job="vote-service"} == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Vote Service is down"

      - alert: HighVoteErrorRate
        expr: rate(vote_errors_total[5m]) / rate(vote_requests_total[5m]) > 0.01
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Vote error rate exceeds 1%"

      - alert: FraudSpikeDetected
        expr: rate(fraud_denied_total[5m]) > 100
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: high
        annotations:
          summary: "Unusual fraud detection spike"

      - alert: DatabaseReplicationLag
        expr: mysql_slave_lag_seconds > 5
        for: 3m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Database replication lag exceeds 5 seconds"
```

**Notification Channels:**

- Critical: PagerDuty + Slack + SMS
- High: Slack + Email
- Medium: Slack
- Low: Email digest

---

### 9.1.7 Instrumentation Standard - OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry (OTel) provides a vendor-neutral instrumentation standard across all services.

**Why OpenTelemetry:**

- CNCF standard
- Unified API for metrics, traces, and logs
- Auto-instrumentation for common frameworks
- Collector for processing and routing telemetry

**OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 OpenTelemetry Collector                          │

│                                        └────────────┘           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**SDK Integration per Language:**

- Node.js: `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`
- Go: `go.opentelemetry.io/otel`
- Python: `opentelemetry-sdk`
- Java: `opentelemetry-java`

---

### 9.1.8 Correlation and Context Propagation

For effective debugging, all telemetry must be correlated:

**Correlation IDs:**

- `trace_id` - Unique per request, propagated across services
- `span_id` - Unique per operation
- `voter_id` - Business context
- `election_id` - Business context
- `request_id` - API Gateway assigned

**Context Propagation:**

- HTTP: W3C Trace Context headers (`traceparent`, `tracestate`)
- Kafka: Headers with trace context
- gRPC: Metadata with trace context

**Grafana Correlation:**

- Click on metric → Jump to related traces
- Click on trace → Jump to related logs
- Unified view with `trace_id` as the correlation key

---

### 9.1.9 Observability for Specific Components

**WebSocket Connections (Real-time Results):**

- Active connection count per region
- Message throughput (in/out)
- Connection duration histogram
- Reconnection rate

**Fraud Service:**

- Risk score distribution
- Decision latency (p99 < 100ms)
- False positive rate (requires manual labeling)
- Model inference time

**External Dependencies:**

- Auth0 API latency and error rate
- Sumsub API latency and error rate
- AWS service health (via CloudWatch)

---

### 9.1.10 Observability Infrastructure Sizing

| Component | Sizing Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Prometheus | 3 replicas per region, 500GB storage each |
| Thanos | Sidecar per Prometheus, centralized Query + Store |
| Jaeger Collector | 3 replicas, auto-scaling on CPU |
| Jaeger Storage | Elasticsearch 3-node cluster, 1TB+ |
| Loki | 3 ingesters, 3 queriers, S3 storage |
| Grafana | 2 replicas behind LB, PostgreSQL backend |
| OTel Collector | DaemonSet on all nodes |

---

### 9.1.11 Runbooks and SLOs

**Service Level Objectives:**

| Service | SLO | Error Budget |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| Vote Submission | 99.99% success rate | 0.01% (~26 min/month) |
| Vote Latency | p99 < 500ms | - |
| Auth Service | 99.95% availability | 0.05% |
| Real-time Results | 99.9% availability | 0.1% |
| Fraud Check Latency | p99 < 200ms | - |

**Runbooks to Create:**

- Regional failover procedure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 10. Core Services Overview

This document describes the three core domain services of the secure
voting platform:

- **Auth Service**
- **Vote Service**
- **Fraud Service**

These services work together with external providers: - **Auth0**
(authentication) - **Sumsub** (biometric identity & liveness) - **Edge
Security / WAF** (Cloudflare or equivalent)

The goal is to ensure: - Strong identity verification - One person = one
vote - Resilience against bots and organized fraud - Full auditability

---

## 10.1 Auth Service

### 10.1.1 Purpose

The Auth Service is the **internal identity authority** of the voting
platform.\
It does NOT replace Auth0 or Sumsub. Instead, it **connects them to the
voting domain** and applies business rules.

It answers one main question: \> "Who is this user inside the voting

## 2. Notification Service

## 3. Producer Service

## 4. Consumer Service
