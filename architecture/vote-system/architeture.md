# 🧬 Realtime Voting System -- Architecture Overview

# 1. 🏛️ Structure

## 1.1 🎯 Problem Statement and Context

This document describes the high-level architecture and security
strategy for a global, real-time voting system designed to support:

- Up to 300 million registered users
- Traffic peaks of 240,000 requests per second (RPS)
- Strict consistency and reliability guarantees
- Strong protection against bots, fraud, and abuse
- One-person-one-vote enforcement
- Near real-time result visibility

The system must be fully cloud-native, highly scalable, fault tolerant,
and secure by design, while explicitly avoiding:

## 1.2 Restrictions

- Serverless platforms outside AWS
- MongoDB
- On-premise infrastructure
- Google Cloud & Microsoft Azure
- OpenShift
- Mainframes
- Monolithic architectures

AWS-based, fully distributed, microservices-first architecture is
assumed.

## 1.3 Problem Space

**What is the problem?**

We need to design and build a globally distributed, mission-critical real-time voting system capable of handling 300 million registered users with peak traffic of 240,000 requests per second. The system must guarantee absolute data integrity, enforce strict one-person-one-vote constraints, provide real-time result visibility, and defend against sophisticated fraud, bot attacks, and abuse at scale—all while maintaining near-zero data loss and high availability across multiple geographic regions.

**What is the context of the problem?**

- **Market Context**:
  - Democratic elections and large-scale voting events demand unprecedented levels of trust, transparency, and reliability
  - Growing threat landscape from automated bots, state-sponsored actors, and coordinated fraud campaigns
  - Increasing expectations for instant feedback and real-time results from 300M+ global participants
  - Zero tolerance for data loss, system failures, or security breaches that could undermine election integrity
  - Need for systems that can scale elastically during unpredictable traffic spikes (campaigns, debates, breaking news)

- **Business Context**:
  - Any data loss or security breach creates legal liability, regulatory penalties, and irreparable reputational damage
  - System must support mission-critical operations with financial and legal consequences
  - One-time deployment windows with no room for failure during live voting periods
  - Requirement for complete auditability and tamper-proof logging for legal compliance
  - Cost optimization critical—infrastructure must scale down after peak periods
  - Must support strict SLAs with penalties for downtime or data inconsistency

- **Technical Context**:
  - Peak traffic of 240K RPS eliminates traditional vertical scaling and monolithic architectures
  - 300M users require geo-distributed sharding, multi-region replication, and CDN distribution
  - ACID guarantees required for vote integrity—NoSQL eventually consistent models insufficient for vote records
  - Real-time requirements demand event-driven architecture (Kafka, SSE) with <2 second latency
  - Cloud-native AWS-only restriction eliminates multi-cloud and serverless options
  - Must handle database bottlenecks through strategic sharding (geo-based), read replicas, and caching
  - Defense-in-depth security model required across network, identity, device, behavior, application, and data layers
  - Need for immutable audit logs and write-once-read-many (WORM) compliance

- **User Context**:
  - 300M users spread across multiple geographic regions with varying network conditions
  - Users expect instant confirmation of vote submission and real-time result updates
  - Users must be authenticated securely without friction (prevent credential stuffing, session hijacking)
  - Mobile and web clients require Server-Sent Events (SSE) for efficient real-time updates
  - Users in different time zones create distributed load patterns with unpredictable spikes
  - Accessibility requirements for diverse user populations (language, disability, device types)
  - Users must vote exactly once—any duplicate vote undermines system integrity

**Core Challenges:**

1. **Data Integrity at Scale**
   - Guarantee zero data loss across 240K RPS with multi-region active-active replication
   - Implement synchronous writes with WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) and fsync guarantees
   - Build tamper-proof immutable audit trails using OpenSearch WORM indices
   - Handle database sharding across 300M users without creating consistency gaps
   - Design automatic failover with RPO=0 (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO<60s (Recovery Time Objective)

2. **Security & Fraud Prevention**
   - Detect and block automated bots at 240K RPS without impacting legitimate users
   - Prevent credential stuffing, session hijacking, replay attacks, and DDoS
   - Implement defense-in-depth: WAF, device fingerprinting, behavioral analysis, rate limiting
   - Validate identity uniqueness across 300M users without centralized bottlenecks
   - Build real-time fraud detection with ML models analyzing voting patterns

3. **Horizontal Scalability**
   - Scale API layer from baseline to 240K RPS using Kubernetes HPA and KEDA
   - Implement geo-based database sharding to distribute 300M user records
   - Design stateless microservices that auto-scale without session affinity issues
   - Optimize cache layers (Redis) to absorb read-heavy traffic and reduce DB load
   - Handle cold-start delays during sudden traffic spikes with pre-warming strategies

4. **Strict Idempotency & One-Vote Enforcement**
   - Guarantee exactly-once vote processing despite retries, network failures, and race conditions
   - Implement distributed locks or optimistic concurrency control at database level
   - Design idempotency keys with conflict resolution for duplicate submissions
   - Prevent race conditions when multiple requests arrive simultaneously for same user
   - Build reconciliation mechanisms to detect and resolve any duplicate votes in audit logs

5. **Real-Time Result Distribution**
   - Stream aggregated results to 300M users with <2 second latency using SSE
   - Design event-driven architecture (Kafka) for vote ingestion and aggregation
   - Handle 250K concurrent SSE connections with minimal server resource overhead
   - Implement efficient broadcast patterns using EventEmitter for SSE clients
   - Balance real-time updates with system load—aggregate summaries vs. individual events

6. **Multi-Region Complexity**
   - Synchronize vote data across geographic regions with strong consistency
   - Handle network partitions (split-brain scenarios) without duplicate votes
   - Route users to nearest region while maintaining global vote count accuracy
   - Implement cross-region disaster recovery with automated failover
   - Manage clock skew and distributed transaction coordination across regions

7. **Performance Under Load**
   - Maintain <100ms p99 latency during 240K RPS peak traffic
   - Prevent database saturation through write buffering, connection pooling, and read replicas
   - Optimize Kafka throughput for event streaming without lag buildup
   - Implement backpressure mechanisms to gracefully degrade under extreme load
   - Cache authentication tokens and session data to reduce repeated DB lookups

# 2. 🎯 Goals

## 2.1 Never Lose Data

Voting systems are mission-critical. Any data loss leads to: 
- Legal risks 
- Loss of public trust 
- Invalid election outcomes

This requires: 
- Multi-region replication 
- Strong durability guarantees
- Strict write acknowledgements 
- Immutable audit logs

## 2.2 Be Secure and Prevent Bots & Bad Actors (Primary Ownership Area)

This is one of the hardest challenges at global scale. The system must prevent:

- Automated voting (bots)
- Credential stuffing
- Distributed fraud attacks
- Replay attacks
- Session hijacking
- API scraping
- DDoS attacks

Security must be implemented in multiple layers (defense in depth): 
- Network
- Identity 
- Device 
- Behavior 
- Application 
- Data

## 2.3 Handle 300M Users

This implies: 
- Massive horizontal scalability 
- Stateless architectures 
- Global CDNs 
- Partitioned databases 
- Multi-region deployment

---

## 2.4 Handle 240K RPS Peak Traffic

It requires:
- Load-based autoscaling 
- Event-driven processing 
- Front-door traffic absorption 
- Backpressure handling

## 2.5 One Vote per User (Strict Idempotency)

This is a data + security + consistency problem: 

Each identity must be: 
- Verified 
- Unique 
- Non-replayable 

Vote submissions must be: 
- Idempotent 
- Conflict-safe 
- Race-condition proof

## 2.6 Real-Time Results

This creates challenges in: 
- Data streaming 
- Cache invalidation 
- Broadcast consistency 
- Fan-out architectures 
- WebSocket / pub-sub scalability

---


# 3. 🎯 Non-Goals

- On-prem or hybrid operation
- Manual moderation for fraud detection
- Single-region deployment
- Strong coupling between frontend and backend
- Vertical scaling
- Centralized bottlenecks
- Stateful monoliths

---


# 4. 📐 Design Principles

The architecture is guided by seven foundational design principles that address the unique challenges of building a mission-critical, globally distributed voting system. These principles inform every architectural decision, from technology selection to deployment strategies.

## 4.1 Security First (Defense in Depth)

**Principle**: Security is not a feature—it's the foundation. Every layer of the system must assume breach and implement independent security controls.

**Why This Matters**:

- Voting systems are high-value targets for nation-state actors, organized fraud, and automated bot armies
- A single security failure can compromise election integrity and destroy public trust
- Attack vectors evolve constantly—security must be layered and adaptive

## 4.2 Scalability by Default (Horizontal, Stateless, Elastic)

**Principle**: The system must scale horizontally without architectural changes. Every component is designed for elastic scaling from day one.

**Why This Matters**:

- Peak traffic (240K RPS) is 100x baseline load—vertical scaling is impossible
- Voting events create unpredictable traffic spikes (debates, breaking news, election day)
- Cost optimization requires scaling down after peak periods

## 4.3 Event-Driven Architecture (Asynchronous, Decoupled, Resilient)

**Principle**: Decouple producers and consumers through event streams. All critical operations are asynchronous to prevent cascading failures.

**Why This Matters**:

- Synchronous request-response patterns create tight coupling and single points of failure
- Database writes at 240K RPS would saturate any relational database
- Real-time result aggregation requires parallel event processing

## 4.4 Stateless Compute (Immutable, Ephemeral, Replaceable)

**Principle**: Application servers hold no persistent state. Every instance is interchangeable and can be destroyed/recreated without data loss.

**Why This Matters**:

- Stateful servers cannot scale horizontally (sticky sessions create hotspots)
- Server failures with in-memory state cause data loss
- Rolling updates and auto-scaling require killing instances without warning

## 4.5 Multi-Layer Anti-Abuse Protection (Adaptive, ML-Driven, Zero Trust)

**Principle**: Assume every request is malicious until proven otherwise. Defense mechanisms adapt in real-time to emerging threats.

**Why This Matters**:

- Bots evolve to bypass static rules (CAPTCHA solving, residential proxies)
- Credential stuffing attacks leverage millions of stolen username/password pairs
- Distributed attacks from 100K+ IP addresses bypass simple rate limiting

## 4.6 Auditable Data (Immutable, Tamper-Proof, Forensic-Ready)

**Principle**: Every vote and system action is recorded in an append-only, cryptographically verifiable audit log.

**Why This Matters**:

- Legal requirements for election audits and recounts
- Post-incident forensics require complete event reconstruction
- Public trust depends on transparent, verifiable vote counting

## 4.7 Failure as a Normal Condition (Chaos Engineering, Graceful Degradation)

**Principle**: Expect failures at every level. Design systems that degrade gracefully and self-heal automatically.

**Why This Matters**:

- At 240K RPS, component failures are guaranteed (hardware, network, software bugs)
- Manual intervention is too slow—recovery must be automatic
- Partial availability is better than complete outage

- Government document verification
- Global fraud risk scoring

Chosen for:

- High antifraud robustness
- Strong global compliance (KYC/AML)
- Support for multiple countries
- High-quality liveness detection against deepfake, photos, and
  replays

SumSub React Native SDK integration:

Documentation: <https://docs.sumsub.com/docs/react-native-module>

**Mobile Flow with SumSub**

1. User installs and opens the React Native app.
2. During first access or registration:
    - User is asked to capture:
        - A selfie video (liveness)
        - A government-issued document
3. The app sends media directly to SumSub SDK.
4. SumSub performs:
    - Face matching
    - Liveness challenge
    - Document authenticity validation
5. The backend receives:
    - Verification status
    - Risk score
    - Unique document hash
6. Only verified users are allowed to vote.

No raw biometric data is stored directly in the voting backend.

### Secure Authentication with Auth0 (SSO + MFA)

Auth0 is used for:

- Secure login
- Social SSO
- Passwordless login
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Token lifecycle management

Documentation: <https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/react-native>

**Authentication Flow**

1. User taps "Login".
2. React Native app redirects to Auth0 universal login.
3. Auth0 performs:
    - Credential validation
    - Social login (if enabled)
    - MFA (Authenticator App, SMS, Push, etc.)
4. On success, the app receives:
    - Access Token (short-lived)
    - ID Token
    - Refresh Token (secure storage only)

### Bot Detection with Auth0 Challenge + Turnstile

To prevent credential stuffing, brute-force, and automated accounts:

- Auth0 Challenges are applied during:
    - Login
    - Registration
    - Password reset
- Cloudflare Turnstile is used as:
    - Invisible human challenge
    - CAPTCHA replacement
    - Bot traffic filter for mobile and web

The Turnstile token is attached to authentication requests and validated
by the backend before granting access.

### Secure API Requests with Tokens

All API requests use:

- OAuth2 access tokens (Bearer)
- Short TTL (e.g., 15 minutes)
- Secure refresh flow
- Token binding to:
    - Device fingerprint
    - Session
    - Risk score

Example:

``` http
POST /vote
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

All backend services:

- Validate the token signature
- Validate expiration and issuer
- Check device consistency
- Enforce authorization scope

### Device Fingerprinting with FingerprintJS

FingerprintJS is used to:

- Collect passive device signals:
    - OS
    - Browser/Runtime
    - Hardware entropy
    - Emulator detection
- Generate a stable device ID
- Detect:
    - Multi-account abuse
    - Bot emulators
    - Device cloning
    - Session hijacking

How it is used:

1. FingerprintJS runs in the app runtime.
2. A device ID is generated.
3. The device ID is attached to:
    - Login requests
    - Voting requests
4. The backend correlates:
    - User Account
    - Document Hash
    - Face Template
    - Device ID

This allows detection of:

- One user trying to vote from multiple devices
- One device trying to impersonate multiple users

| **Deployment**      | Single deployment unit            | Independent deployments per service       | Faster iteration; more operational overhead   |
| **Team Structure**  | Single team, shared codebase      | Multiple teams, service ownership         | Better for large teams; coordination overhead |
| **Fault Isolation** | Single failure affects entire app | Failures contained to individual services | Critical for high availability requirements   |
| **Data Management** | Shared database                   | Database per service                      | Accept eventual consistency between services  |

### Key Principles Applied

1. **Security over convenience**
2. **Consistency over availability**
3. **Managed services over custom**
4. **Horizontal over vertical scaling**

## DB-enforced FK vs Application-enforced

| **Aspect**                           | **DB-enforced FK (with indexes & CASCADE)**                                                                             | **Application-enforced (no DB constraints)**                                                             | **Analysis**                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Integrity & Consistency**     | **Guaranteed** – ACID-compliant, impossible to create orphaned records. Constraints validated in every transaction.     | **Risk-prone** – depends on application logic. Bugs or race conditions create inconsistencies over time. | DB-enforced is rigid but mathematically sound. Application-enforced needs eventual consistency patterns and reconciliation. Orphaned data often discovered late. Distributed systems with multiple DBs force app-enforced. |
| **Write Performance & Throughput**   | **Moderate to Low** – FK validation overhead on INSERT/UPDATE (index lookup + lock acquisition per write).              | **High** – No constraint checks. Critical for >10k writes/sec where FK checks become bottleneck.         | DB FKs add ~10-30% overhead per write. Each INSERT/UPDATE validates relationships. App-enforced wins for write-heavy workloads but sacrifices safety. Measure with production-like volume.                                  |
| **Read Performance & Query Patterns** | **Excellent** – Auto-indexed FK columns, JOINs use index seeks O(log n), optimizer leverages FK metadata.               | **Same if indexed** – Must manually index FK columns. Without indexes, JOINs = full table scans O(n²).   | Non-indexed FKs catastrophic: 100ms query becomes 30s+. DB-enforced auto-creates indexes. App-enforced needs disciplined index management and monitoring.                                                                   |
| **Scalability & Distribution**       | **Poor for microservices** – FKs cannot span databases. Forces monolithic DB or complex 2PC. Sharding breaks FKs.       | **Natural fit** – Services own data, manage relationships via APIs/events. Enables polyglot persistence. | DB FKs lock into single-DB. Moving to microservices requires removing FKs (risky). App-enforced needs saga patterns, event sourcing, idempotency. Choose based on 5-year vision.                                           |
| **Operational Complexity & Risk**    | **High** – Migrations on 100M+ rows take hours with locks. Cascades can accidentally delete millions (production horror stories). | **Lower for changes** – Logic in code, zero-downtime deploys. Higher risk of silent corruption.          | Adding FK to existing data = full scan + lock. Tools like gh-ost help but add complexity. RESTRICT prevents cascade disasters but needs explicit cleanup. App-enforced enables agile deploys.                               |
| **Debugging & Observability**        | **Explicit errors** – FK violations fail fast with clear messages. Root cause immediate. Impossible states prevented.   | **Silent failures** – Issues found late in reports/audits. Needs data quality metrics and reconciliation. | DB FKs = immediate feedback. App-enforced issues manifest as "data doesn't add up". Needs orphaned record detection and dashboards. Long-term cleanup costs can exceed performance gains.                                  |
| **Best For**                         | Monolithic apps, transactional systems, regulated domains (finance/healthcare), small teams, data quality > performance | Microservices, high-scale writes, eventual consistency OK, mature DevOps teams, flexibility > safety     | **Use DB FKs for**: orders, payments, user accounts. **Use app-enforced for**: cross-service relationships, analytics, >10k writes/sec. Hybrid common. Re-evaluate when scaling. Migration later is painful.                |

## Database SQL vs No-SQL

| **Criteria**                   | **SQL Databases**                                                                   |**No-SQL databases**                                       | **Notes** |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Consistency** | Strong (ACID)    | Eventual (in most cases)                                 | **SQL**: Guarantees ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Changes are immediately visible to all users after commit. Critical for voting systems where vote counts must be accurate in real-time. **NoSQL**: Most NoSQL databases prioritize availability and partition tolerance (CAP theorem), using eventual consistency where changes propagate over time. Cassandra, DynamoDB offer tunable consistency but at performance cost. |
| **Scalability** |  Mainly vertical                     | Horizontal | **SQL**: Scales by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to a single server (vertical scaling). Sharding is possible but complex. **NoSQL**: Designed for horizontal scaling - adding more servers to distribute load. Handles massive data volumes across distributed nodes naturally. |
| **Schema**       | Rigid | Flexible                  | **SQL**: Requires predefined schema with strict data types and relationships. Changes require migrations (ALTER TABLE). Ensures data integrity but less adaptable. **NoSQL**: Schema-less or flexible schema allows storing varied document structures. Easy to add new fields without migrations, but application must handle data validation. |
| **Transaction**  | Complex and fully supported                 | Limited           | **SQL**: Full ACID transaction support across multiple tables with JOIN operations, foreign keys, and complex queries. Can handle multi-step operations atomically. **NoSQL**: Most support single-document/row transactions only. Some (MongoDB, DynamoDB) added multi-document transactions but with performance penalties. Complex transactions require application-level coordination. |
| **Complexity**   | Lower for relational data                                  |    Higher at the application level                   | **SQL**: Database handles relationships, constraints, and data integrity. Application code is simpler for relational data. Mature tooling and widespread expertise. **NoSQL**: Application must handle data relationships, consistency checks, and complex queries. Requires careful data modeling and denormalization strategies. |
| **Performance**     | Good for transactional workloads           | Excelent for high data volume                        | **SQL**: Optimized for complex queries with JOINs, aggregations, and ACID transactions. Performance degrades with very large datasets without sharding. **NoSQL**: Excels at simple read/write operations on massive datasets. Optimized for high throughput and low latency at scale. Less efficient for complex analytical queries. |

## Pros

- High horizontal scalability
- Schema flexibility
- Better performance for large data volumes
- High availability
- Ideal for distributed workloads

## Cons

- Eventual consistency (in most cases)
- Less support for complex transactions
- Complex queries can be more difficult
- Greater application responsibility for data consistency

## NoSQL or SQL?

All recommendations for voting systems are to use SQL databases. 

Why Not NoSQL for Vote System?
* NoSQL lacks strong ACID guarantees by default.
* Even with configurable consistency (e.g., quorum reads/writes in Cassandra), you’re trading performance for complexity.
* For mission-critical voting paths, use PostgreSQL with strict isolation (Serializable level) and sharding.

## Use NoSQL for:

* Logs (vote_cast events)
* Audit trails
* High-throughput analytics pipelines

# 10. 💿 Data store settings

![Database Diagram](diagrams/database-diagram.png)

The system uses a multi-database strategy:

- **PostgreSQL (RDS Multi-AZ)**: Transactional data for voters, elections, and votes with strong ACID guarantees

Each microservice owns its schema, avoiding cross-service queries through event-driven architecture, this alse reduces the need of FKs in database.

## 10.1 Data Integrity & One-Vote Enforcement

- Globally unique voting token
- Single-use cryptographic vote key

Database enforces: 
- Strong uniqueness constraints 
- Atomic conditional writes 
- Conflict detection

# 11. 👀 Observability and Monitoring

A robust observability strategy is critical for a system of this scale and criticality. We adopt the **three pillars of observability**: Metrics, Logs, and Traces and all using Open Source tools.

## 11.1 Stack Overview

| Pillar | Tool | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Metrics | Prometheus | Time-series collection and alerting |
| Visualization | Grafana | Dashboards and unified observability UI |
| Tracing | Jaeger | Distributed tracing |
| Logs | Loki | Log aggregation (Prometheus-native) |
| Alerting | Alertmanager | Alert routing and notification |
| Service Mesh Observability | OpenTelemetry | Instrumentation standard |


## 11.2 Metrics - Prometheus

Prometheus is the core metrics engine, chosen for its Open Source nature and Kubernetes-native design.

**Key Features:**

- Pull-based time-series collection via exporters
- Powerful query language (PromQL)
- Built-in alerting rules
- Service discovery for dynamic environments
- Integration with AWS via CloudWatch Exporter

**Exporters to Deploy:**

- `node_exporter` - Host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- `kube-state-metrics` - Kubernetes object states
- `cloudwatch_exporter` - AWS service metrics (RDS, SQS, ElastiCache, etc.)
- `blackbox_exporter` - Endpoint probing (HTTP, TCP, DNS)
- Custom application exporters for each microservice

**Critical Metrics to Monitor:**

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| Application | Request rate, error rate, latency (p50, p95, p99) |
| Business | Votes per second, fraud detection rate, auth success rate |
| Infrastructure | CPU, memory, disk I/O, network throughput |
| Kubernetes | Pod restarts, pending pods, node availability |
| Database | Connection pool, query latency, replication lag |
| Queue | Message age, queue depth, consumer lag |

```

For 300M users and high cardinality, consider **Thanos** or **Cortex** for:

- Long-term metric storage (S3-backed)
- Global query view across regions
- Downsampling for historical data

    - RED metrics (Rate, Errors, Duration)
    - Dependency health
    - Resource utilization

3. **Security & Fraud Dashboard**
    - Bot detection triggers per minute
    - Fraud check decisions (ALLOW/CHALLENGE/DENY)
    - Auth failures and suspicious patterns
    - WAF block rate

4. **Infrastructure Dashboard**
    - Kubernetes cluster health
    - Node resource saturation
    - Database replication status
    - Queue depths and consumer lag

5. **Business Metrics Dashboard**
    - Total votes cast (real-time)
    - Votes per region/election
    - User registration funnel
    - Peak traffic patterns


## 11.4 Distributed Tracing - Jaeger

For a microservices architecture at this scale, distributed tracing is essential to understand request flow and identify bottlenecks.

**Why Jaeger:**

- Open Source (CNCF graduated project)
- Native OpenTelemetry support
- Scalable architecture with Kafka and Elasticsearch/Cassandra backends
- Adaptive sampling for high-volume systems

**Tracing Architecture:**

```

**Instrumentation Strategy:**

| Service | Instrumentation |
|---------|-----------------|
| API Gateway | Auto-instrumentation via OpenTelemetry |
| Auth Service | Manual spans for Auth0/Sumsub calls |
| Vote Service | Manual spans for eligibility check, fraud check, vote persist |
| Fraud Service | Manual spans for risk scoring pipeline |
| Database calls | Auto-instrumentation with query tagging |
| External APIs | Manual spans with timeout tracking |

**Key Spans to Capture:**

- `http.request` - Incoming HTTP requests
- `auth.validate_token` - Token validation
- `auth.check_eligibility` - Voter eligibility check
- `fraud.check_vote` - Fraud risk assessment
- `vote.persist` - Vote storage operation
- `db.query` - Database operations
- `external.auth0` - Auth0 API calls
- `external.sumsub` - Sumsub API calls

**Sampling Strategy:**

For 240K RPS, full tracing is not feasible. Use adaptive sampling:

- 100% sampling for errors and high-latency requests
- 1% sampling for successful requests
- 100% sampling for fraud-flagged requests
- Head-based sampling with tail-based upgrade for anomalies


## 11.5 Log Aggregation - Loki

Loki provides log aggregation that integrates natively with Grafana and uses the same label model as Prometheus.

**Why Loki:**

- Open Source (Grafana Labs)
- Lightweight - indexes labels only, not full text
- Cost-effective storage (S3-backed)
- Native Grafana integration
- LogQL query language (similar to PromQL)

**Log Architecture:**

```

**Structured Logging Standard:**

All services must emit structured JSON logs:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "vote-service",
  "trace_id": "abc123",
  "span_id": "def456",
  "voter_id": "vtr_789",
  "election_id": "election_2026",
  "message": "Vote recorded successfully",
  "duration_ms": 45
}
```

**Required Log Labels:**

- `service` - Service name
- `environment` - prod/staging/dev
- `region` - AWS region
- `level` - Log level (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)

**Log Retention Policy:**

- ERROR logs: 90 days
- WARN logs: 30 days
- INFO logs: 14 days
- DEBUG logs: 3 days (staging only)


## 11.6 Alerting - Alertmanager

Prometheus Alertmanager handles alert routing, deduplication, and notification.

**Alert Categories:**

| Severity | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Critical (P1) | < 5 min | Service down, data loss risk, security breach |
| High (P2) | < 30 min | High error rate, degraded performance |
| Medium (P3) | < 4 hours | Elevated latency, resource warnings |
| Low (P4) | Next business day | Non-critical warnings |

**Critical Alerts for Voting System:**

```yaml
# Example alert rules
groups:
  - name: voting-critical
    rules:
      - alert: VoteServiceDown
        expr: up{job="vote-service"} == 0
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Vote Service is down"

      - alert: HighVoteErrorRate
        expr: rate(vote_errors_total[5m]) / rate(vote_requests_total[5m]) > 0.01
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Vote error rate exceeds 1%"

      - alert: FraudSpikeDetected
        expr: rate(fraud_denied_total[5m]) > 100
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: high
        annotations:
          summary: "Unusual fraud detection spike"

      - alert: DatabaseReplicationLag
        expr: mysql_slave_lag_seconds > 5
        for: 3m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Database replication lag exceeds 5 seconds"
```

**Notification Channels:**

- Critical: PagerDuty + Slack + SMS
- High: Slack + Email
- Medium: Slack
- Low: Email digest


## 11.7 Instrumentation Standard - OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry (OTel) provides a vendor-neutral instrumentation standard across all services.

**Why OpenTelemetry:**

- CNCF standard
- Unified API for metrics, traces, and logs
- Auto-instrumentation for common frameworks
- Collector for processing and routing telemetry

**OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 OpenTelemetry Collector                          │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**SDK Integration per Language:**

- Node.js: `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`
- Go: `go.opentelemetry.io/otel`
- Python: `opentelemetry-sdk`
- Java: `opentelemetry-java`


## 11.8 Correlation and Context Propagation

For effective debugging, all telemetry must be correlated:

**Correlation IDs:**

- `trace_id` - Unique per request, propagated across services
- `span_id` - Unique per operation
- `voter_id` - Business context
- `election_id` - Business context
- `request_id` - API Gateway assigned

**Context Propagation:**

- HTTP: W3C Trace Context headers (`traceparent`, `tracestate`)
- Kafka: Headers with trace context
- gRPC: Metadata with trace context

**Grafana Correlation:**

- Click on metric → Jump to related traces
- Click on trace → Jump to related logs
- Unified view with `trace_id` as the correlation key


## 11.9 Observability for Specific Components

**WebSocket Connections (Real-time Results):**

- Active connection count per region
- Message throughput (in/out)
- Connection duration histogram
- Reconnection rate

**Fraud Service:**

- Risk score distribution
- Decision latency (p99 < 100ms)
- False positive rate (requires manual labeling)
- Model inference time

**External Dependencies:**

- Auth0 API latency and error rate
- Sumsub API latency and error rate
- AWS service health (via CloudWatch)


## 11.10 Observability Infrastructure Sizing

| Component | Sizing Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Prometheus | 3 replicas per region, 500GB storage each |
| Thanos | Sidecar per Prometheus, centralized Query + Store |
| Jaeger Collector | 3 replicas, auto-scaling on CPU |
| Jaeger Storage | Elasticsearch 3-node cluster, 1TB+ |
| Loki | 3 ingesters, 3 queriers, S3 storage |
| Grafana | 2 replicas behind LB, PostgreSQL backend |
| OTel Collector | DaemonSet on all nodes |


## 11.11 Runbooks and SLOs

**Service Level Objectives:**

| Service | SLO | Error Budget |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| Vote Submission | 99.99% success rate | 0.01% (~26 min/month) |
| Vote Latency | p99 < 500ms | - |
| Auth Service | 99.95% availability | 0.05% |
| Real-time Results | 99.9% availability | 0.1% |
| Fraud Check Latency | p99 < 200ms | - |

**Runbooks to Create:**

- Vote Service degradation
- Database failover
- Fraud spike response
- DDoS attack response
- Regional failover procedure

# 12. Auditablitity

# Immutable Audit Storage Architecture for Voting System
## Supporting 300M Users with PostgreSQL Sharding

---


### 12.1.1 Cost Analysis (Estimates for 300M users)

**Assumptions:**
- 300M votes over 24 hours
- Average vote record: 1KB (JSON with hash chains)
- Retention: 10 years
- Total storage: ~300GB

#### S3 Object Lock Costs

```
Storage (S3 Standard):
- 300GB × $0.023/GB/month = $6.90/month
- Annual: $82.80

PUT Requests:
- 300M votes × $0.005/1000 = $1,500 (one-time)

GET Requests (auditing):
- Assuming 1% verification rate
- 3M reads × $0.0004/1000 = $1.20/month

Total First Year: ~$1,600
Total Annual (after year 1): ~$100
```

#### Amazon QLDB Costs

```
Storage:
- 300GB × $0.10/GB/month = $30/month
- Annual: $360

I/O Requests (Writes):
- 300M × $0.40/1M = $120

Read Requests (auditing):
- 3M reads × $0.15/1M = $0.45/month

Total First Year: ~$485
Total Annual (after year 1): ~$365
```

**Cost Verdict:** S3 is **~3-5x cheaper** than QLDB for this use case.

### 12.1.2 Tradeoffs Summary

#### Choose S3 Object Lock when:
✅ Cost is a primary concern  
✅ You need unlimited scale  
✅ Simple append-only audit log is sufficient  
✅ You can implement hash chains in application  
✅ You don't need to query the audit logs directly  

#### Choose QLDB when:
✅ You need built-in cryptographic verification  
✅ You want to query audit history with SQL-like syntax  
✅ You need automatic hash chain management  
✅ Budget allows for higher costs  
✅ Throughput requirements are < 10K req/sec

## 12.2. Why NOT to Use PostgreSQL for WORM

### 12.2.1 PostgreSQL Limitations

PostgreSQL is a **transactional database**, not an immutable ledger. Key issues:

**Unrestricted Modifications:**
- Database administrators can UPDATE any record
- DELETE operations can remove audit evidence
- Entire tables can be dropped, including audit tables
- Triggers can be disabled to bypass audit mechanisms

**No Built-in WORM:**
- PostgreSQL is designed for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- The "UD" (Update, Delete) directly conflicts with WORM requirements
- No native immutability features

### 12.2.2 Attempted Solutions and Why They Fail

#### Attempt 1: Audit Tables with Triggers

**Approach:** Create a separate audit table that logs all changes via database triggers.

**Problems:**
- ❌ DBA can disable triggers
- ❌ DBA can delete audit table
- ❌ No cryptographic proof of integrity
- ❌ No WORM guarantee

#### Attempt 2: Revoke DELETE/UPDATE Permissions

**Approach:** Remove modification permissions from all users, including application users.

**Problems:**
- ❌ Superuser/owner can still modify
- ❌ Can drop and recreate table
- ❌ Physical file access on server
- ❌ Backup restoration can rollback state

#### Attempt 3: Use Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

**Approach:** Rely on PostgreSQL's write-ahead log for audit trail.

**Problems:**
- ❌ WAL is for crash recovery, not auditing
- ❌ WAL files are rotated/deleted
- ❌ Not designed for long-term retention
- ❌ Can be manipulated with physical access

### 12.2.3 Fundamental Issue

PostgreSQL's purpose is **mutable transactional data**, not immutability:

```
PostgreSQL Philosophy:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ACID Transactions                   │
│ - Atomicity                         │
│ - Consistency                       │
│ - Isolation                         │
│ - Durability                        │
│                                     │
│ BUT: Allows modification by design  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

WORM Philosophy:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Append-Only                         │
│ - Write once                        │
│ - Never modify                      │
│ - Never delete                      │
│ - Cryptographic proof               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Conclusion:** Use PostgreSQL for operational data, use dedicated WORM storage (S3/QLDB) for audit trail.

```

### 12.3.2 Detailed Component Design

#### 12.3.2.1 PostgreSQL Sharding Strategy

**Sharding Key Options:**

**Option 1: Shard by Region** (if voting is geographically distributed)
- Create separate tables for each geographic region (US_EAST, US_WEST, EU, etc.)
- Simple routing based on voter location
- Good for compliance requirements with data locality

**Option 2: Shard by voter_id hash** (uniform distribution)
- Hash the voter_id and use modulo operation to determine shard
- Creates uniform distribution across shards
- Example: shard_id = hash(voter_id) % 16
- Better load balancing across all shards

**Recommended:** 16 shards initially, can increase as needed based on load patterns.

#### 12.3.2.2 Vote Service Implementation

**Core Responsibilities:**
1. **Vote validation** - Ensure voter hasn't already voted
2. **Shard determination** - Calculate which PostgreSQL shard to use based on voter_id hash
3. **Transactional write** - Insert vote into appropriate PostgreSQL shard
4. **Hash chain calculation** - Retrieve previous hash and calculate current hash
5. **Async audit publishing** - Send audit log to message queue for S3 persistence

**Hash Chain Logic:**
- Retrieve the hash of the previous vote (from cache or S3)
- Calculate current hash: SHA256(prev_hash + vote_id + voter_id + candidate_id + timestamp)
- This creates a tamper-evident chain where any modification breaks the sequence

**Error Handling:**
- PostgreSQL write failure → Vote is rejected, return error to client
- Message queue publish failure → Log error but don't fail the vote (will be retried)
- This ensures votes are never lost due to audit system issues

#### 12.3.2.3 Audit Writer Service (S3 Consumer)

**Core Responsibilities:**
1. **Consume from message queue** - Read audit log messages from Kafka/RabbitMQ/SQS
2. **Write to S3 with Object Lock** - Persist audit logs as immutable objects
3. **Create checkpoints** - Every 10,000 votes, create a checkpoint file with cumulative hash
4. **Retry logic** - Handle failures and retry S3 writes to ensure no audit logs are lost

**S3 Organization Structure:**
```
s3://voting-audit-bucket/
  votes/
    checkpoint_0000000001/
      vote_0000000001.json
      vote_0000000002.json
      ...
      vote_0000010000.json
      checkpoint.json         ← Summary with final hash
    checkpoint_0000000002/
      vote_0000010001.json
      ...
```

**Object Lock Configuration:**
- Mode: COMPLIANCE (cannot be deleted even by root account)
- Retention: 10 years from creation date
- Ensures true WORM behavior

**Checkpoint Files:**
- Created every 10,000 votes
- Contains: checkpoint_id, last_vote_id, last_hash, timestamp
- Enables fast verification without reading all individual vote files
- Can be digitally signed for additional security

#### 12.3.2.4 S3 Bucket Configuration

**Required Settings:**

**1. Object Lock Enabled**
- Must be enabled at bucket creation (cannot be added later)
- Provides WORM capability

**2. Versioning Enabled**
- Required for Object Lock to work
- Maintains all versions of objects

**3. Object Lock Configuration**
- Mode: COMPLIANCE (strongest protection - even root cannot delete)
- Default Retention: 10 years
- Alternative: GOVERNANCE mode (allows privileged users to override)

**4. Lifecycle Policies**
- Transition to Glacier after 90 days to reduce costs
- S3 Standard: $0.023/GB/month
- Glacier: $0.004/GB/month (saves ~83%)
- Objects remain accessible but with longer retrieval time

**Cost Optimization:**
- First 90 days: S3 Standard (fast access for recent audits)
- After 90 days: Glacier (cold storage for compliance)
- Deep Archive option: $0.00099/GB/month for long-term archival

### 12.3.3 Data Flow

#### Write Path (Synchronous)

```
1. Client → Vote Service
   └─ POST /api/v1/votes
      {
        "voter_id": "voter_abc123",
        "candidate_id": "candidate_xyz"
      }

2. Vote Service:
   ├─ Validate voter (not duplicate)
   ├─ Determine shard: hash(voter_id) % 16 = shard_7
   ├─ PostgreSQL INSERT into votes_shard_7
   │  └─ Returns vote.id = 12345678
   ├─ Get prev_hash from Redis/S3
   ├─ Calculate current_hash
   └─ Publish to Kafka topic "audit-logs"

3. Response to Client:
   └─ 201 Created
      {
        "vote_id": 12345678,
        "status": "recorded"
      }
   
   Duration: ~50-100ms
```

#### Audit Path (Asynchronous)

```
1. Kafka Consumer (Audit Writer Service):
   ├─ Consume message from "audit-logs"
   ├─ Prepare JSON with hash chain
   └─ S3 PUT with Object Lock
      └─ Key: votes/checkpoint_0001234/vote_0012345678.json

2. Every 10,000 votes:
   └─ Create checkpoint file
      └─ Key: votes/checkpoint_0001234/checkpoint.json

Duration: ~500ms-2s (async, doesn't block vote)
```

### 12.3.4 Verification Process

**Hash Chain Integrity Verification:**

The verification process ensures no tampering has occurred by validating the entire hash chain:

1. **Retrieve all votes in a checkpoint** - List all vote files from S3 for a given checkpoint
2. **Sort chronologically** - Order votes by their ID to follow the chain sequence
3. **Verify each link** - For each vote, confirm:
   - The prev_hash matches the previous vote's current_hash
   - Recalculating the current_hash produces the same result
4. **Detect tampering** - Any modification to vote data or hash values will break the chain

**Types of Verification:**

**Real-time Verification:**
- Performed during vote submission
- Validates the last N votes in the chain
- Catches issues immediately

**Batch Verification:**
- Run periodically (e.g., end of each checkpoint)
- Validates entire checkpoint from first to last vote
- Confirms no retroactive tampering

**Full Audit:**
- Validates the complete voting history
- Can be performed by independent auditors
- Checkpoint files enable faster validation by verifying checkpoint summaries first

**Public Verifiability:**
- Checkpoint digests can be published publicly
- Third parties can verify without accessing individual votes
- Enables transparent auditing while protecting voter privacy

### 12.3.5 Why This Architecture?

✅ **Separation of Concerns:**
- PostgreSQL: Fast operational queries, sharded for scale
- S3: Immutable audit trail, cryptographic proof
- Kafka: Decouples write paths, enables retries

✅ **Scalability:**
- PostgreSQL sharding: 16 shards × 10K writes/sec = 160K votes/sec
- S3: Unlimited storage, high throughput
- Kafka: Buffer for traffic spikes

✅ **Cost-Effective:**
- PostgreSQL: Standard RDS pricing
- S3: ~$100/year for 300M votes
- Kafka: Managed service (MSK) or self-hosted

✅ **Reliability:**
- Async S3 writes don't block votes
- Kafka provides durability and retries
- Object Lock prevents tampering

✅ **No Lambda Required:**
- Dedicated microservices for control
- Easier debugging and monitoring
- Can deploy in Kubernetes/ECS

## 12.4. Summary and Recommendations

### For a 300M User Voting System:

**✅ Recommended: PostgreSQL (sharded) + S3 Object Lock**

- **PostgreSQL:** Operational data, fast queries, proven scalability
- **S3 Object Lock:** Immutable audit trail, lowest cost, unlimited scale
- **Message Queue:** Decouple write paths, enable async processing
- **Microservices:** Full control, no Lambda cold starts

**Cost:** ~$100-500/year for audit storage (vs. $60K+ for Datomic)

**Why NOT QLDB:** 3-5x more expensive, throughput limits

**Why NOT Datomic:** 500-1800x more expensive, write bottleneck, overkill

**Why NOT PostgreSQL alone:** No true WORM, admin can tamper

# 13. ⚙️ Core Services

This document describes the core domain services of the secure voting platform.

## 13.1 Auth Service

**Scope:**
- User registration and identity verification
- Session management and token issuance
- Integration with Auth0 for authentication
- Integration with Sumsub for KYC validation
- One-person-one-vote enforcement through identity uniqueness

The Auth Service is the **internal identity authority** of the voting
platform.

It does NOT replace Auth0 or Sumsub. Instead, it **connects them to the
voting domain** and applies business rules.

It answers one main question: \> "Who is this user inside the voting


## 13.2 Vote Service

**Scope:**
- Survey creation and management (CRUD operations)
- Vote submission and validation
- Idempotency enforcement (one vote per user per survey)
- Vote aggregation and results calculation
- Eligibility verification before accepting votes
